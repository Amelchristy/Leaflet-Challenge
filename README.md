# Leaflet-Challenge

I completed this project during my Data Analysis and Visualization Bootcamp at the University of Pennsylvania. The purpose of the assignment was to learn how to implement plot data and visualization using Javascript. To learn this skill effectively, I visualized data sets to create a map displaying where earthquakes had occurred in the United States.   

There were two datasets I implemented in this assignment. The first was a dataset gathered in the JSON format from United States Geological Survey’s (USGS) website GeoJSON Feed. The data marker on the map shows the magnitude of the earthquake by its size and depth and displays them in different colors for easier visibility and grouping. The second dataset was from a repository given by the instructors. This was then used to plot the tectonic plates around the world to see if there is any relationship between these plates and seismic activity.  

Once the data was implemented correctly, I was able to plot it on my map through Leaflet Javascript, which visualized where earthquakes could occur. I was also able to build in the interactive aspect of the data map allowing users to define their own settings for viewing the data.
